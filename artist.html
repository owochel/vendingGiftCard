          <p>
            Each card typically costs $2 and can be applied toward any future
            payment you may owe shuang. However, many of shuang's services do
            not require payment, particularly those both shuang and consumer
            considered as collaboration. As a result, any unsettled balance
            should be settled upon request.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            shuang acknowledges that this is not a viable business model and
            fully intends for it not to turn their life and passion into a
            successful business, but rather a node in the vast connections
            across all creative minds.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are unhappy with any aspect of the service, please contact
            shuang directly to discuss your concerns. Your satisfaction is
            important, and shuang is committed to resolving any issues to ensure
            a positive experience.

          replace them for you but you should expect a lot of eye-rolls and
          annoyance from shuang.
